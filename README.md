# Pre-work - *Custom Input Colorized*

**Custom Input Colorized** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Leann Abellanosa**

Time spent: **45-50** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [ ] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
    - [ ] I could have implemented a reset button so it would have gone back to its default settings. 
    - [ ] Adding a more wide range of random colors, but more specifically, adding different randomized hues to please the audience. 
    - [ ] Using other elements other than buttons.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The challenges that I had encountered were when I deleted a part of my code that I did not want anymore and deleted an element, my application would not run at all. As a result, I had to completely start over from scratch. I did this about 5-6 times as I could not figure out why it would not run. 

Another challenge was that learning how to implement new ideas that I have never learned before like the use of extension and delegate. It was a struggle learning those and trying to implement them to my application in order for me to add cool concepts to the app.
